# School District Data Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing the district-wide standardized test results of a school district. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and patterns in school performance based on math and reading scores, as well as other information about the schools.

## Background

As the Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, your role is to assist the school board and mayor in making informed decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. To fulfill this responsibility, you have been assigned the task of analyzing the district-wide standardized test results.

You will have access to a dataset that includes math and reading scores for every student in the district, along with additional information about the schools they attend. By aggregating and analyzing this data, you will be able to uncover important insights and trends related to school performance.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files required for the analysis.
  - `students.csv`: CSV file containing information about students, including their math and reading scores.
  - `schools.csv`: CSV file containing information about the schools, including their names and various attributes.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data analysis and manipulation using Pandas DataFrames.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install pandas` in your terminal.
4. Open the `analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Execute the code cells sequentially to load and analyze the data.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of two main files:

1. `students.csv`: This file contains information about each student, including their unique ID, math score, reading score, school ID, and other relevant attributes.
2. `schools.csv`: This file contains information about each school, including its unique ID, name, type, and additional characteristics.

## Data Analysis

In the `analysis.ipynb` notebook, you will find code and explanations for performing various data manipulations and analyses using Pandas DataFrames. Some of the tasks you will accomplish include:

- Loading the dataset into DataFrames
- Exploring the data to understand its structure and contents
- Aggregating the data to calculate overall school performance metrics
- Visualizing the data to identify trends and patterns
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the analysis
